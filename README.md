# React Finland Statecharts Workshop

This project was forked from [David's workshop repo](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate-react-workshop) in my attempt to practice developing UIs with statecharts. My approach is following the commits in the `answers` branch, trying to implement the features without straightup copying the code as I'm looking at it. We'll see how this goes!

Statecharts are a powerful, well-established formalism that describe even the most complex application behavior and logic in a visual, hierarchical, and deterministic way. In this workshop you will learn about finite state machines and statecharts, and apply them to real-life React applications in ways that will increase productivity and eliminate entire classes of possible bugs from your code. You will also learn how to:

- Refactor React applications of any size to use statecharts, piece by piece
- Auto-generate full integration tests
- Visualize application logic
- Analyze statecharts to determine which user flows can be optimized
- Identify all possible edge cases
- Apply late-breaking changes and requirements methodically
- Auto-generate designs of all possible component states with Storybook
- Use advanced features of XState

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
